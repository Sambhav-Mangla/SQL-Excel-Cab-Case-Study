# SQL-Excel-Cab-Case-Study
**Objective** 
To analyze the impact of discounts offered by a cab company for its services to the ridership of its customers by comparing key metrics across 3 weeks:
  1) Week 1: No discounts
  2) Week 2: Discounts applied
  3) Week 3: Discounts removed (pricing back to Week 1 level)
The goal is to determine whether discounts lead to increased ridership, revenue growth, or improved customer retention.

**Problem Statement**
The taxi service provider wants to evaluate whether offering discounts is a sustainable strategy for increasing customer engagement and revenue. The key concerns are :
  1. Did the discount period (Week 2) results in higher ridership?
  2. Was there a significant increase in revenue or just a shift in user behavior?
  3. After removing discounts (Week 3), did customer retention remain high or return to Week 1 levels?
  4. Should the company continue offering discounts, and if so, in what form?

**Conclusion**
1. The company's customer base has grown significantly, and even after the removal of discounts, new customers continue to be attracted to the cab service.
2. During the discount period (Week 2), revenue growth was significant for Gold and Platinum cab types but minimal for Silver. Revenue increased by 154% for Gold, 40% for Platinum, and only 9% for Silver.
3. Despite an increase in the customer base, user experience has declined, as reflected in lower client ratings. This decline may be attributed to inaccurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) during bookings.
   Implementing measures such as employing experienced drivers and leveraging advanced technology for accurate ETA predictions can enhance the overall user experience.
5. There is a scope in expansion for mid to long distance drive market as its still untapped and the usage of Silver type cab can be increased.
6. The company should discontinue offering discounts, as customer awareness has increased and retention rates are strong. The primary focus should now be on optimizing the pricing strategy to enhance profitability.
